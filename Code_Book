The attached R script (run_analysis.R) performs the following to clean up the data:
Merges the training and test sets to create one data set, namely train/X_train.txt with test/X_test.txt,

Reads features.txt and extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
The result is a 10299x66 data frame, because only 66 out of 561 attributes are measurements on the mean and standard deviation

Reads activity_labels.txt and applies descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set:
walking
walkingupstairs
walkingdownstairs
sitting
standing
laying
